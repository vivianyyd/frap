TIPS: A few things that might be helpful to keep in mind as you work on Pset 8
===========================================================================


The `set` type
==============

- `set A` is a set of values of type `A`.

- Common operators include `x \in s` (membership), `s1 \subseteq s2`
  (inclusion), `s1 \cup s2` (union).  Because of the way sets are implemented,
  `x \in s` is the same as `s x`.

- Sets can be used in conjunction with maps: `restrict s m` computes a new map
  from `m` with all variables not in set `s` removed.

- If you find yourself proving properties of sets, especially regarding
  `restrict`, try the `sets` tactic — it often helps.

- If you want to reason on whether a particular element `k` is in set `s`, you
  can use the `excluded_middle` tactic, as `excluded_middle (k \in s)`.

Here is an example demonstrating some of these points (remember that, to prove
equality on maps, you can use the `maps_equal` tactic):
|*)

Goal forall {K V} (k: K) (v: V) (s: set K) (m: fmap K V),
    k \in s ->
    restrict s (m $+ (k, v)) = (restrict s m) $+ (k, v).
Proof.
  simplify.
  maps_equal.
  - rewrite lookup_restrict_true.
    + simplify; equality.
    + eassumption.
  - excluded_middle (k0 \in s).
    + rewrite !lookup_restrict_true by assumption.
      simplify; equality.
    + rewrite !lookup_restrict_false by assumption.
      equality.
Qed.

HINTS: A few hints to help you if you get stuck on certain problems in Pset 8.
       Beware! Don't read further if you don't want spoilers!
=============================================================
|*)






































(*|
HINT 1: Generalize `non_interference`
=====================================

You will need to generalize the noninterference theorem statement to prove it by induction.
*)





































(*|
HINT 2: `invert`ing `Confidential` hypotheses
=============================================

Some of your theorems will take `Confidential … c` premises.
In the case of a while loop, `invert`-ing `Confidential pub pc (While e body)`
will give you `Confidential pub (pc \cup vars e) body`, but you will lose the
original `Confidential pub pc (While e body)` fact. In our proof, we had to
reprove it (you could also make a copy of it) a few times, to apply a theorem
to the `eval _ (While _ _) _` premise of the `EvalWhileTrue` constructor.
(This hint will make more sense when you get there.)
