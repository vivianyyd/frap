(** * Subtyping *)

(* We can't resist fitting in another crucial aspect of type systems:
 * *subtyping*, which formalizes when any value of one type should also be
 * permitted as a value of some other type. Languages like Java include
 * *nominal* subtyping, based on declared type hierarchies. Instead, here we
 * will prove the soundness of *structural* subtyping, whose rules we'll get to
 * shortly. The simply typed lambda calculus will be our starting point. *)

 * constituents *)

 What does it mean for the subtyping order of the arguments in `StFun` to be 
 reversed?


 If t1 $<: t2, what is known about some t3 that is a supertype of t2? And 
 likewise if it's a subtype of t1?


 How many goals do you get from calling `invert` on a hypothesis like
 ```
 has_ty G (Abs x e1) t
 ```
 with the `LambdaCalculusAndTypeSoundness` definition of `has_ty`, and what 
 information do you have about `t`?

 To contrast, how many goals do you expect with the `has_ty` definition of
 this pset? Why is this the case? 

 Can you formulate a lemma that consolidates the information present in these 
 branches into one conclusion? (Imagine inverting now is equivalent to an
 "or" generating branches for each constructor; can you rephrase a lemma that
 leads to a conclusion with an "and" instead?)


 How many goals do you get from calling `invert` on a hypothesis like
 ```
 has_ty G e (Fun t1 t2)
 ```
 with the `LambdaCalculusAndTypeSoundness` definition of `has_ty`, and what 
 information do you have about `e`? 

 To contrast, how many goals do you expect with the `has_ty` definition 
 of this pset? Why is this the case? 

 Can you formulate a lemma to recover information similar to what inverting
 gave you in FRAP's `has_ty` definition?

(* The real prize: prove soundness of this type system.
 * We suggest starting from a copy of the type-safety proof from the book's
 * EvaluationContexts.v.
 * The soundness argument for simply typed lambda calculus is genuinely difficult
 * (a celebrated result!). We're not expecing you to reinvent it. Rather, the
 * task of this pset is to *extend* it to cover subtyping. This will involve
 * changing some proofs and making appropriate additional helper lemmas (there
 * are more hints in Pset7Sig.v).
 * Trying to write this proof from scratch is *not* recommended for this pset.
 * This is in contrast to the *previous* psets, which we tried to design so that
 * they could be solved from scratch with a good understanding of the lecture
 * material. *)
