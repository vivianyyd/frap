TIPS: A few things that might be helpful keep in mind as you work on Pset 4
===========================================================================
 *)

(*|
Paper proof and reasoning will help
===================================
Problem set 4 is a lot less guided than previous assignments: you will need to prove multiple lemmas for each of the BST theorems, and we did not give the exact statement of each lemma.  Think about the proofs on paper, take each proof slowly, and do not hesitate to prove useful intermediate results as separate lemmas.

And if you get stuck, come to office hours!
 *)

(*|
Take advantage of propositional
===============================
When writing specifications, you can enable [propositional] to prove more stuff
by sticking to a minimal convention about which comparison operators you use.
We chose to pick [x<y] over [y>x] and [not (y<x)] over [x<=y]. This helps just
a little.

HINT 1: 
=======
Definition rotR (T : tree) :=
  match T with
  | Node t L R =>
      match L with
       | Node l A B => Node l A (Node t B R)
       | _ => T
      end
  | _ => T
  end.

Lemma bst_rotR T S (H : bst T S) : bst (rotR T) S.
Proof.
  cases T; propositional.
  cases T1; propositional.
  simplify; propositional;
    use_bst_iff_assumption; propositional; linear_arithmetic.
Qed.

Definition rotL (T : tree) :=
  match T with
  | Node t A R =>
      match R with
       | Node r B X => Node r (Node t A B) X
       | _ => T
      end

Lemma bst_rotL T S (H : bst T S) : bst (rotL T) S.
Proof.
  cases T; propositional.
  cases T2; propositional.
  simplify; propositional.
  { eapply bst_iff.
    { eassumption. }
    { propositional.

(*|
HINT 2:
=======
Consider [cases (rightmost tr2)] or [cases (is_leaf tr2)] instead of [cases
tr2]. Not breaking apart the tree itself can avoid a mess.
*)





































(*|
HINT 3:
=======
A convenient way to specify "the largest element in this set" is to say that
all elements in this set are no larger than the given element.
*)





































(*|
HINT 4:
=======
merge_ordered needs a rather strong precondition. It does not work correctly
for merging just any two trees. However, it is called in a rather specific
scenario. (And it is feasible to prove its use by inlining it, but we found a
separate specification helpful.) Why is it bad to call merge_ordered [3,4] [1,2]?
*)





































(*|
HINT 5:
=======
Our proof, if avoiding eapply, contains a couple of long apply-with invocations, for example:
apply bst_iff with (P:=let S := (fun x : t => S x /\ d < x) in (fun x : t => S x /\ x < rm)).
